There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

**Input:** m = 3, n = 7
**Output:** 28

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 2
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

# Solution
first row/first column:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 

say in the `grid[i][j]` would indicate how many way you can go to that location. It's neighbor to the right would have the same paths + the combinations from its neighbor from the top.

`grid[i][j+1] = grid[i][j] + grid[i-1][j+1]`
