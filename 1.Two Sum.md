I used the simple linear algorithm with two index pointers.

The core idea of cutting the excess comparisons is that if we our first pointer is in position $i$ and we haven't yet found the element that equals the target, then we can be sure that by setting $j < i$ we absolutely won't find the desired target.

# Solution in Java
```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {  
    for(int i = 0; i< nums.length; i++){  
        for(int j=i+1; j<nums.length; j++){  
            if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target){  
                return new int[] {i, j};  
            }  
        }  
    }  
    return new int[] {};  
}
```
